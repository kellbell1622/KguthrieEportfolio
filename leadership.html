	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Grant Proposal:</span> I developed this grant proposal in my planning for technology course. This helped me learn about how to write a grant for technology. I can use these skills in the future when I apply for a grant for my school or classes.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Khan Academy PD Presentation:</span> <a href="Khan Academy Image.png" target="_blank">Click to view artifact</a>
</p>	<p>Description: During our math collaborative meeting where we discuss data and best practices, I prepared a presentation on how to use Khan Academy in your classroom. I described the different ways of assigning practice assignments and videos to students. I also showed them how to access the students scores and progress on their grade level. </p>

<p>Impact: Teachers were very happy to learn more about Khan Academy and the resources they provide. After my presentations, many of the math department members created their classes in Khan Academy and have been using this resource in their classroom. This will impact student learning and standardized test scores. </p>

<p>Intent: I plan to continue to share presentations on new technology tools that are working in my classroom. It was very effective for math colleagues and I hope to create a sign up sheet for sharing best practices next year for our meeting. Each week one staff member will be in charge of giving a presentation on a strategy that is working with their students and that they want to share with the math department. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Technology Teacher Assistance for Classroom Instruction:</span> <a href="erinn image.png" target="_blank">Click to view artifact</a> </p>
	
	<p>Description: I use technology daily in my classroom. I use many online programs such as Desmos, Pearson, Khan Academy, SOLE, Google Sites, Google Classroom, etc. My students bring their Chromebook to class every day and use it at least 3 times per week in class. I also use my Smartboard daily. I have helped many teachers learn how to use these resources in their classrooms. Many teachers at my school need assistance with using these technology tools and I offer to help as much as possible.</p>
	
	<p>Impact: Helping my colleagues with using these technology resources, increases their students' engagement and achievement because after I show them how to use the resources, they are able to use them in their instruction. It also helps them make their classes more current and helps them complete tasks faster such as formative assessments.</p>
	
	<p>Intent: Next year, I plan to create more PD within our math meetings and instructional improvement days. I also plan on assisting more teachers during this time. I will let teachers know which resources I am know how to use very well in my instruction and ask who needs help using this resource in their classroom. </p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Participation in SIP(School Improvement Process):</span> <a href="SIP.pdf" target="_blank">Click to view artifact</a> </p>
<p>Description: I participated in SIP this past year. During this SIP day, my school met with other schools in our district to discuss student data and how to improve this data using different instructional strategies. This relates to technology leadership because we developed an online teacher mentoring system and discussed technology teaching tools.  </p>
	
<p>Impact: The online mentoring system that I helped develop at the SIP day, helped teachers sign up to observe teachers and provide feedback. It also let teachers sign up if they wanted observed by their teacher colleagues. We also developed the evaluation tool that teachers would use to evaluate their teacher colleagues. The tool was an online Google Form.   </p>
	<p>Intent: Next year, I plan to continue participating in leadership committees to help other teachers learn how to use technology and improve their teaching practice.</p>
