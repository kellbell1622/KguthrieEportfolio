<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Implementation of Khan Academy:</span> <a href="Flipped Classroom.pdf" target="_blank">Click to view artifact</a>
</p>	<p> Description: My students are given Khan Academy assignments and mastery goals for their grade level. They track their percentage on a wall poster. They are expected to complete the assignments given to them and work on missions for extra credit. The missions percentage is based on each math concept in their grade level and how much of the content they have demonstrated mastery in. I learned about this resource while in the IT program and have shared my successes with my classmates in the program as well. </p>

<p>Impact: My students test scores and achievement have increased from using Khan Academy. They also enjoy using Khan Academy because of the "energy points" they earn to increase their percentage. Khan Academy helps my students practice information and provides interventions such as hints/videos if they need extra help. </p>

<p>Intent: I plan on continuing to use Khan Academy for classroom assignments. Next year, I am going to make a form that they use to track their mastery for each section of content and a goal setting book for their mastery percentage. This encourages them to reflect on their learning and the areas they need to improve in. Also, I will continue to help my colleagues who want to implement Khan Academy in their classroom.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Implementation and Creations of Quizizz:</span> <a href="https://quizizz.com/join/quiz/5bd328d46d07f5001b9d7589/start?referrer=5a5e48ddde6868000f33a14a" title="Quizizz Link" target="_blank">Quizizz Link</a></p>
	
	<p>Description: I created many Quizizz review activities after learning about this awesome technology resource in on of my IT program classes. During the program, there were many times that my classmates shared technology instructional resources in the discussion board. I learned about Quizizz from one of the IT master's students and started using it right away. 
</p>
	
	<p>Impact: My students have enjoyed working on Quizizz for extra practice and review all year. It has improved their achievement. It is an engaging resource with many different settings so I can can use it for homework, quizzes, and extra practice on google classroom. My students engagement and math learning has increased as a result of using Quizizz. 
</p>
	
	<p>Intent: I plan on using Quizizz in the future for in class practice and reviews. I also want to put practice links on my Google Classroom and website. This will provide a fun resource for  students to practice what we are learning in class. I also want to share what I have learned about Quizizz and how I use it in my classroom by creating a PD for my math department.
