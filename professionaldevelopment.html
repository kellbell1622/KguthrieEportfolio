</p>	<p>Description: I attended the Akron Public Schools Technology Summit. During this summit, we rotated to different classrooms to learn about new technology tools to use in the classroom and how to use them. It was the entire day. I included the notes I took at each location as an artifact. 


  </p>



<p>Impact: I learned about many different types of technology tools that I later implemented into my classroom. I learned about Ed-puzzle. I have not had a chance to use this with my students. The most influential session was about Peardeck. Peardeck is an online resource that students have an interactive PowerPoint. They can answer questions as you teach by drawing on the slides, moving objects on the slides to answer questions, and other effects. You can see students answer responses instantly and this can be used to address students who are not understanding. 

 
 </p>

<p>Intent: Reflecting on this technology summit, I have realized that I need to start using Peardeck more often with my students. My goal is to use Peardeck at least once a week for the next 2 months of school. I want to see if using Peardeck will increase my student's engagement and achievement.

	<p>Description: I completed professional development through 1 to world modules. These modules were online and they included the topics above. 



</p>
	
	<p>Impact: I learned many new things about keeping students safe online and about educational technology. I enjoyed learning new information about Google programs and student-centered learning. The new information I learned changed my instructional teaching practices and helped me implement new ideas in the classroom such as more Google Chromebook apps. 

 

</p>
	
	<p>Intent: I plan to continue taking PD relating to technology to improve my teaching methods/strategies. I want to continue learning more about new educational technology tools each year.
