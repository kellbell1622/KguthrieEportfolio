<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Implementation of Flipped Classroom:</span> 
	
	<a href="flippedimages.pdf" target="_blank">Click to view artifact</a> </p>

</p>	<p>Description: I learned about a flipped classroom more during the IT program. Since my students do well with independent work and are intrinsically motivated, I knew it would work well with them. I decided to implement flipped classroom tools such as Khan Academy and Pearson assignments relating to the content. I assigned videos for the students to watch and then complete certain assignments based on the skill. While my students are working on their work, I walk around assisting specific students that are struggling based on the data I collect on Khan Academy and Pearson. Most of the time students will watch the videos at home for homework and then complete the extra practice assignments with me in class. 
  </p>

<p>Impact: Students have more time to complete their assignments in class and they have more time to ask questions. I can give more one-on-one attention to students that are struggling. Since the assignments are online, students have access to hints and videos for each question for help as well. Student achievement has increased while using the flipped classroom strategy. 
 </p>

<p>Intent: I plan on sharing this method with my colleagues and what I have learned utilizing a flipped classroom so far. I want to plan a PD session for our personal learning committee meetings to discuss strategies for using a flipped classroom and how to create a flipped classroom learning environment. I also want to change my plan for next year. I want to have students watch more videos/lessons at home. I plan on creating more videos to share on the Google Classroom and then have more days at school for the students to practice the assignments.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Implementation of Mastery Based Learning Using Technology:</span> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKxlt9Qznlsa0mfO1ZDyDVbgB3lwd6Mh3vHtxbqz9yrId2EQ/viewform" title="Google Form Link" target="_blank">Mastery Based Learning Retake Assessment Request Form</a></p>
	
	<p>Description: I have learned a lot about the importance of mastery based learning for teaching mathematics. I used my technology skills to develop a more mastery based learning classroom that uses strategies such as assessment retakes. My artifact is a google form that students can request to retake an assessment after they proved they have reviewed their mistakes and practiced the concepts on the test in order to do better. 

</p>
	
	<p>Impact: Students grades and achievement have improved from mastery based learning strategies. My classroom is a place that they can feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from their mistakes. 

</p>
	
	<p>Intent: Next year, I plan to use mastery methods such as a grid method where students retake assessments until they get a 80% or higher. They will keep track of their own learning and move unto the next topic after they master the previous one.
