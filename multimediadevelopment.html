	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mini Projects 1-5:</span> For my Hypermedia/Multimedia course, I learned about to create codes for a website. These mini-projects helped me learn how to code a web page, use Photoshop, create audio for my website, validate my codes, and create a video presentation.

We created a online learning system used for language arts. We collected data from different people to adjust and make changes to the website during the creation.

</p>	<p> Description: After creating a Google Site for multiple courses in the IT program, I learned how to use and create useful sites for my students. I never knew about  Google Sites before being in the IT program! For this school year, I created a website for my students. Each tab has the grade level and extra credit opportunities. The homepage explains useful programs if they need extra help including tutoring. Since all of the agendas are posted on the site, students can look at the website if they are absent to see what they missed or at home to make sure they completed all of their homework. It is also very useful for parents to know what assignments are due and when they are due.  </p>

<p>Impact: Finally being able to create a user friendly website for my students has been very beneficial. Parents are happy to be able to know when assignments are due. Also, students can always check the website if they forget their is homework and they can check if they are absent what homework we have. </p>

<p>Intent: Next year, I plan on adding more to my website. I want to add more resources and game links for students to practice skills. I also want to have students refer to the website more during class on what needs to be completed.  </p>

	<p>Description: After creating my video presentations about the projects I have created in the IT program, I learned how to make video presentations to teach my students concepts at home. I started creating video presentations with Screencast-o-matic about math concepts and post the videos on my Google classroom. 
</p>
	
	<p>Impact: I never knew that tools existed like Screencast-o-matic until the IT program. Now I can create video lessons for my students to watch if they are confused about a concept or if they are absent. I also assign students to watch these videos at home before class the next day as homework so the class period can be spent practicing the skill taught in the video. This is called the flipped classroom method of teaching. Students enjoy having these videos to pause and learn from at home to help them while completing the assignment.
</p>
	
	<p>Intent: I plan to create more of a mastery based teaching style next year and making videos for each concept. I want to create a more flipped classroom environment to help promote mastery based learning.
