<p>Hello, my name is Kelly Guthrie. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Instructional Technology! 
My bachelor's degree is in middle school math and science. I currently teach 6th, 7th, and 8th grade math in Akron Public Schools. I have been teaching for 5 years. This website showcases what I have learned in my Instructional Technology Master's Program at the University of Akron. This website will include artifacts from my courses and reflections of those artifacts.

<h3> Technology Vision Statement </h3>

<p>My background for using technology in the classroom involves a lot of training and experience with successful student achievement. I have been trained on using a 
variety of technology resources 
including Desmos, Peardeck, and Quizziz. I also use a Smartboard on a daily basis to project math problems, videos, and graphs. It allows me to easily write 
next to the problem, and graph equations. I also started using Khan Academy in my class a couple years ago and my students have definitely had more achievement 
using this resource. It provides a lot of intervention or enrichment problems and has videos/hints for each problem if my students need it. My students also can work 
on Khan Academy missions which help them master the entire grade level math they are in. Using these resources and seeing my students succeed has helped developed my 
technology vision. 
I believe technology is an amazing tool that needs to be used in classrooms on a daily basis. Technology should be used to help create engaging and fun lessons for students. 
For example, "Effectively applied content neutral technologies increase student's access to information and ideas and enhance student to student and student to teacher 
interactions 
to support and enrich sense making." For students to learn be successful as 21st century learners, they did to know how to use technology effectively and creatively to 
solve real-world problems. Teachers need to teach using technology resources to prepare students to be successful in their future careers. This can be supported by 
"Findings from a number of studies have shown that the strategic use of technological tools can support both the learning of mathematical procedures and skills as well as 
the development of advanced mathematical proficiencies, such as problem solving, reasoning, and justifying" ("Strategic Use of Technology," 2015). 
My goal as an educator is to teach students how to use technology safely. I want to use technology to differentiate instruction on a daily basis and also provide fun, 
engaging lessons the students will relate to. Teachers need to teach students how to be critical thinkers and how to collaborate using technology as well. </p>
